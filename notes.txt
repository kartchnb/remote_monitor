This project is an attempt to allow multiple monitors to be connected to a computer remotely using virtual outputs and VNC.  The result is what I'm calling a "remote monitor"  
So far, I've had success with up to 3 remote monitors using a combination of an Android cell phone, Android tablet, and a Raspberry Pi running Rasbian.

To Configure your Linux computer as a remote monitor host:
1) Copy 20-intel.conf to /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/
    > sudo cp 20-intel.conf /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/
2) Reboot.
3) Determine the ip address of the host computer.
    > ifconfig
4) Assign a "display number" (1-4) to the remote monitor.  This should be unique to each remote monitor.
5) Determine the port the remote monitor should use (default is 5900 - it's recommended to go up from there).  Each remote monitor must use a different port.
6) Determine the resolution of the remote monitor (this can easily be found by navigating to http://whatismyscreenresolution.net/).
7) Pass these parameters to launch.py for each remote monitor.
    > /usr/bin/python3 launch.py <DISPLAY NUMBER> <HORIZONTAL RESOLUTION> <VERTICAL RESOLUTION> <PORT>
8) Follow the prompts to arrange the displays and launch VNC.


To use an Android device as a remote monitor
1) Us bVNC: Secure VNC Viewer


To use a Raspberry Pi as a dedicated remote monitor:
1) Install a fresh OS install.
2) Configure to automatically boot into the Console.
3) Probably a good idea to enable SSH as well.
4) Install Tight VNC Viewer.
    > sudo apt-get install xtightvncviewer
5) Copy the remote-monitor.config file to the Raspberry Pi and customize it as needed.
6) Copy the start-remote-monitor.sh file to the Raspberry Pi.
7) Modify the .bashrc file to launch the VNC viewer after login.
    # Continuously attempt to connect the remote monitor (unless in an SSH session)
    while [[ -z ${SSH_TTY} ]]
    do
        ./start-remote-monitor.sh
    done



TODO: 
    The launch.py should handle command-line parameters better.
    Keep track of the virtual displays in use so that a "display number" and "port" can be automatically assigned rather than specified.

    

I've tried the following Android VNC viewers:

    - bVNC: Secure VNC Viewer
        Seems to work well, but has an annoying splash screen that comes up every time
        Might be worth buying the Prop version
        This is the best app I tried and is pretty much perfect for what I need
        Set scaling to "Fit to Screen" works the best

    - TSVNC
        Forces landscape
        Really nice otherwise.  Automatically launches into fullscreen.
        Shows a small dot in the center (local mouse?) but that's not a huge issue - can be manually moved out of the way
        No settings that I could find


    -------- NO BUENO BELOW THIS POINT --------

    - Vnc Viewer - Remote Desktop
        Does not display the remote computer's mouse, which renders it useless

    - VNC Viewer for Android
        Forces the display to landscape
        Must set scaling to "Fit to Screen"
        I can't figure out how to get the menu to come up sometimes
        Doesn't seem to want to go full screen
        Seems slower than the other options

    - MultiVNC
        A little annoying that the screen can't automatically be scaled to Fit
        Maybe a little slow?
        The menu can't be turned off

    - Desktop VNC Viewer
        Ads. Yuck.
        Display artifacts
        Menu items can't be turned off

    - droidVNC-NG
        VNC server, not a viewers

    - TruVnc Secured Vnc Client
        Trial basis
        Displays the mouse the best
        Fullscreen isn't really fullscreen

    - Mocha VNC Lite
        Lots of settings
        Also won't go full screen (Android bars appear on top and bottom)

    - RemoteToGo RDP/VNC For Android
        Didn't try because it wanted access to my photos...

    -aRDP: Secure RDP Client
        RDP only
        
I've tried the following Linux VNC clients:
    - TigerVNC
        > sudo apt install xvnc4viewer
        Doesn't display the cursor, which renders it useless
        
    - Vinagre (Icon shows as Remote Desktop Viewer)
        > sudo apt install vinagre
        Doesn't display the cursor
        
    - Xtightvncviewer
        > sudo apt install xtightvncviewer
        Ran with the following command lines and options. 
        Worked well, fullscreen, mouse, but couldn't exit
            > xtightvncviewer -viewonly -fullscreen -noraiseonbeep -x11cursor 192.168.0.39:0
            > xtightvncviewer -viewonly -fullscreen -noraiseonbeep -nocursorshape 192.168.0.39:0
