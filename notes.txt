I've tried the following Android VNC viewers:

    - bVNC: Secure VNC Viewer
        Seems to work well, but has an annoying splash screen that comes up every time
        Might be worth buying the Prop version
        This is the best app I tried and is pretty much perfect for what I need

    - TSVNC
        Forces landscape
        Really nice otherwise.  Automatically launches into fullscreen.
        Shows a small dot in the center (local mouse?) but that's not a huge issue - can be manually moved out of the way
        No settings that I could find



    - Vnc Viewer - Remote Desktop
        Does not display the remote computer's mouse, which renders it useless

    - VNC Viewer for Android
        Forces the display to landscape
        Must set scaling to "Fit to Screen"
        I can't figure out how to get the menu to come up sometimes
        Doesn't seem to want to go full screen
        Seems slower than the other options

    - MultiVNC
        A little annoying that the screen can't automatically be scaled to Fit
        Maybe a little slow?
        The menu can't be turned off

    - Desktop VNC Viewer
        Ads. Yuck.
        Display artifacts
        Menu items can't be turned off

    - droidVNC-NG
        VNC server, not a viewers

    - TruVnc Secured Vnc Client
        Trial basis
        Displays the mouse the best
        Fullscreen isn't really fullscreen

    - Mocha VNC Lite
        Lots of settings
        Also won't go full screen (Android bars appear on top and bottom)

    - RemoteToGo RDP/VNC For Android
        Didn't try because it wanted access to my photos...

    -aRDP: Secure RDP Client
        RDP only
